# Crypto

## Affinity

> I just found out that the source code for AES is public. How can I trust that my secrets won't be decrypted if the decryption algorithm is public. Since I'm a genius, I decided to make some modifications and roll my own crypto. Now you'll never decrypt my secret!

## Probably Insecure

> I'm sure nobody remembers the fiasco from DiceCTF when I thought I had proven my cipher was secure. Can you fool this signature service?

# Reverse

## Reading List

> I created this binary to keep track of some strings that I want to read. I thought I put a CTF flag in it so I'll remember to make a problem for UTCTF, but I can't seem to find it...

# Forensics

## What Time is It?

> Super Secure Company's database was recently breached. One of the employees self reported a potential phishing event that could be related. Unfortunately, our Linux email server does not report receiving any emails on March 2, 2023. Can you identify when this email was actually sent? The flag format is `utflag{MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM}` in UTC time.
